# Taskmaster Dashboard - Project Summary

## Overview
A standalone Kanban-style dashboard that visualizes Taskmaster tasks in real-time, running independently of the user's development environment.

## What We're Building
- **Package Name**: `taskmaster-dashboard`
- **Technology Stack**: Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Deployment**: Standalone web application (separate from user's Next.js app)

## Key Features
- **Real-time Task Visualization**: Kanban board showing pending, in-progress, and completed tasks
- **Multi-Project Support**: Each project gets its own dashboard instance
- **Auto-Refresh**: Watches `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` for live updates
- **Port Management**: Runs on ports 5000+ to avoid conflicts with development servers

## User Experience
```bash
# Installation
npm install -g taskmaster-dashboard

# Usage
cd /path/to/project
taskmaster-dashboard serve
# Opens dashboard at http://localhost:5000
```

## Technical Architecture
- **CLI Tool**: Global npm package with binary entry point
- **Web Dashboard**: Vite dev server serving React app
- **File Watcher**: Monitors tasks.json for real-time updates
- **Port Management**: Auto-detects available ports in 5000-5999 range

## Business Value
- **Developer Productivity**: Visual task management alongside coding
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared task visibility across projects
- **Zero Integration**: No conflicts with existing development workflows
- **Open Source**: Can be published to npm for community adoption

## Development Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Core dashboard with basic Kanban functionality
- **Phase 2**: Real-time updates and file watching
- **Phase 3**: Multi-project support and port management
- **Phase 4**: Advanced features (filtering, sorting, analytics)

## Success Metrics
